**Python 3.12.0** was used to create the application files. Before running the files, it must be ensured that Python 3.12.0
and the following libraries are installed: 
**Sklearn, 
Numpy,
Pandas, 
Matplotlib.**
The implementation phase consists of 5 steps, which are: 1- Pre-processing 2- Statistics 3- Attack Filtering 4- Feature Selection 5- Machine Learning Implementation 
The file with the ML_Project.ipynb extension has the advantage of saving the state of the last run of that file and the screen output. 
Thus, screen output can be seen without re-running the files. This file can be run using the Jupyter Notebook program.
Each step is described in detail in Report.pdf.
